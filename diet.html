<p>For most people, chocolate is heaven. However, many end up avoiding eating chocolate for fear of being fat. But did you know that eating chocolate can help you lose weight?</p>
<p>A study from Irish Independent quoted from Boldsky shows that eating sweet foods such as chocolate cake, biscuits or other snacks can make you burn excess weight. Morning is considered the best time to consume junk food because that's when the body's metabolism reaches its peak and can burn more calories than other times.</p>
<p>Another benefit of having chocolate cake for breakfast is that it can help regulate a hormone called 'ghrelin', which is responsible for stimulating appetite. It helps by suppressing hunger at other meals.</p>

<p>Breakfast is very important but that does not mean you can consume food in the morning excessively. Overeating at breakfast is better avoided because it can cause digestive disorders later. Summarized from various sources, here are 3 causes of overeating at breakfast:</p>
<p>1. Out of focus</p>
<p>Often we overeat because we are distracted, generally because of cell phones or other gadget screens. Simple movements to focus more when eating can help control excessive eating habits. Avoid playing mobile or breakfast while watching television, because it will make us not focus on what we will eat and tend to be dissatisfied with our food.</p>
<p>2. Emotional</p>
<p>It is common for us to overeat when we feel emotional, like sadness, anger, or even pleasure. Food is not enough to cover our feelings. You can work around this by calling friends, chatting at breakfast, or replace with exercise in the morning such as walking or meditation.</p>        
<p>3. Depression</p>
<p>An American Psychological Association's Stress in America survey, published in February 2014, found that 38 percent of adults overeat because of stress. Cortisol levels soar when we feel stressed and the results, as well as our appetite, makes us crave more fatty or sweet foods. For some people stress can not be avoided, but can overcome it with morning exercise, a healthier breakfast, and change lifestyle.</p>
